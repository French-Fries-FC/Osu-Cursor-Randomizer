# Osu-Cursor-Randomizer
This program was originally made for fun. It is used to randomizer the cursor of your Osu! skin using given file names. It CAN be use for randomizing every file, but do so at the risk of messing up your skin.

The file is NOT set up correctly! Furthur instructions for the set up and use of the config file will be place later. 

I plan to update this overtime!
